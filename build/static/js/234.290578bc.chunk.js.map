As human societies became more widespread and sophisticated, most issues couldn't be discussed collectively. Representatives with similar mindsets and ideals were chosen to handle the difficulty. It was an indirect democracy, because it had no direct involvement with most citizens in decision-making and law-making. The people had to depend on their representatives to support policies in their interest. Democracy is evolving itself with the assistance of 21<sup>st&nbsp;</sup>century technology, where citizens are getting more active in making laws governing themselves. Linked to the current, liquid democracy is the latest political invention. It’s a combination of direct and representative democracy. You’ll be able to either vote on issues you care about otherwise you know, or he/ she will delegate his/her vote to you on problems with less interest to themselves. Liquid democracy reflects the power and ability in higher cognitive processes, special values, attitudes, and ideas.</p>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>&nbsp;</p>\n                <h2>Sovereign People, Right to Information and Participation</h2>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>Many people are dissatisfied with modern democracy because of the interaction between the political elites, corporate and the media in framing policy. Representative democratic systems were designed on the philosophy of republicanism, where there's no place for collective intelligence. Nowadays, ICT has increased the speed of information transmission. It’s also changed the way political participation and expression. In almost all modern democracies and republics, sovereignty belongs to the people. The right to access information is recognized as an element of freedom of expression under United Nations Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Representative democracy could also be the practice for the uninterrupted functioning of the country, but in principle, what principle is mentioned in the manifesto, what happened next and what was done cannot be justified. Democracy is all about transparency, accountability and good governance. The people have the right to investigate the actions of their leaders and to have a full and open debate about those actions. For this, it's the duty of the state to help in accessing information on the state of the economy, social system and other issues of public concern.</p>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>&nbsp;</p>\n                <h2>Contribution and Medium&nbsp;</h2>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>It is an aim for each last citizen of the country to be active and give their full contribution to policy making. Citizens do not worry about voting or reading and writing an excessive amount of politics that affects them. They bypass political discussions. Dissatisfaction with political participation is really caused by not realizing that their values and concepts are represented. Increased citizen participation within the political landscape is often encouraged through the technologies we've got for liquid democracy.</p>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>&nbsp;</p>\n                <h2>Information Technology: Helping Hands</h2>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>A society where people live together really stands on the mountain of problems. Collective intelligence is practiced to seek the answer underlying the problems. To answer, opinions expressed are literally the policy. Policy may be a tool for solving any problem. Policy isn't so complicated; it's complicated once we understand election of representatives as politics. When the present government implements decisions not mentioned within the election mandate, people don't get an opportunity to express their views on the issue. The government doesn't know whether the people prefer it or not. With the assistance of the internet, dynamic decision-making, liquid representation, and cohesive governance are possible within the existing political culture. Your vote could also be cast by your representative or by an appointed representative (delegate) or by yourself. Only with limited resources, like a simple mobile phone and reliable internet access, it's possible to participate in democratic practice. We are preparing and training the needs of the country from today while encouraging both the users and the uninterrupted functionaries of the country for the results to come.</p>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>&nbsp;</p>\n                <h2>Least, We Can Do</h2>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>One can pick and formally address legislative bodies with the mandate.</p>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>&nbsp;</p>\n                <h2>Responsibility and Statutory Limit</h2>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>The privacy of people, the territorial integrity and sovereignty of a country cannot be compromised.
