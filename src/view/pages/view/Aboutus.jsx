                We have lots of complaints about the situation of the country, the behavior of the
                representatives and the state of the society. Sovereign people being unorganized, some
                complaints may not be heard. In the past, the dimension of society was simple and the
                solution to the problem was sought by gathering in place through collective
                intelligence. After the society scattered in the geography, this effort was taken forward
                through the representatives. The representatives were guided by a certain idea and
                classified intelligence. But society is a whole of collective intelligence where the
                experience of the problem is different, the solution is also different. Putting everyone
                together and allowing them to choose their own solutions to all agendas / issues is the
                best use of collective intelligence. Nowadays, information technology makes this
                possible. This is the politics. The representatives can monitor mandate and facilitate it
                into formality under unintermittant succession of the country. Complaints if shared out
                of a limited circle and the experiences of others remain the same, it will take a
                momentum.
